# simple-linear-regression-gradient-descent

Semester: 4

Subject: ML Techiniques + Lab

Date: 12th January 2022

Examination: CIA - 1

Duration: 3 hours


Question:

1. Generate 1000 random points (x,y)

2. Build a simple linear regression from scratch

3. Use gradient descent to find the optimal slope and intercept value

Till Step 3 - no use of sklearn. However numpy and pandas may be used as needed.

4. Apply sklearn on the dataset and find the best fit slope and intercept. Compare the values obtained in step 3 and 4 and write your inference from that.
